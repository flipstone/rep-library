  Newtypes
    | A "newtype" is a type defined with tha `newtype` keyword. It is a
    | trivial wrapper around an existing type that creates a brand new type
    | out of it that the compiler will treat as different from the original
    | type. This is useful for many things, including distinguishing between
    | values that would otherwise be the same simple type. The compiler
    | removes newtype wrappers at compile time so that there is littre to
    | no runtime cost associated with having many newtypes.

- Define a type using newtype to represent a person's Name
- Implement a function nameToString to convert a Name to String
- Define a type using newtype to represent a person's Hometown
- Implement a function hometownToString to convert a Hometown to String
- Define a type using newtype to represent a person's Age
- Define a Person record using these three types.
- Construct a value of type Person.
- Implement a function to create a String introducing a Person by stating their
  name and where they are from. Be polite and omit their age from the
  introduction.

| Newtypes can also be used create a wrapper for the purpose of providing
| a new typeclass instance for a type that already has one. We will use this
| technique in these reps occasionally to allow us to re-write the typeclass
| implementations in common libraries as a way to understand them better.


- define an Eq instance for Hometown that is equivalent to the one for String
- define an Eq instance for Name that compares names in a case-insensitive manner.
