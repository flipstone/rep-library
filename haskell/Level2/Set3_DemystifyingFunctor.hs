{-

This rep is intended to clear the fog around two common Functors that we use
in Haskell by having you implement them yourself. It lays a good foundation
for diving deeper into functors.

- Implement your own version of Maybe
- Implement map for your Maybe
- Create Functor instance for your Maybe

- Implement your own version of List
- Implement map for your list
- Create Functor instance for your List

- Write out a sample value using your types that is Maybe a List of Strings
- Write out a sample value using your types that is a List of Maybe Strings

- Write a function to get the length of all the strings in your Maybe List of Strings
  - Once using the mapping fuctions you wrote for you types explicitly
  - Once using the Functor instances via fmap

- Write a function to get the length of all the strings in your List of Maybe Strings
  - Once using the mapping fuctions you wrote for you types explicitly
  - Once using the Functor instances via fmap

- Finally, write a function that can get the length of all the strings in either
  one of the values above by using the Functor instance of both your types.
