{-

Foldable represents a structure that, given a suitable "folding" function, can
be collapsed into a new value without the structure.

In these reps you'll practice the various ways Foldable can be implemented and
the how to implement it on different kinds of datastructures.

- Implement a type like Maybe
- Write an instance of Foldable including both foldMap and foldr for your Maybe
- Write a newtype around List
- Write an instance of Foldable including both foldMap and foldr for your "List"
