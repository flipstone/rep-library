# A Library of Reps

> Ability equals knowledge plus 10,000 times. - Shinichi Suzuki

This repo provides a library of tiny coding exercises that you can do some of
every day to build your muscle memory. Incorporating more syntax and library
knowledge into your muscle memory improves your productivity and frees up
higher-level cognitive processing to focus on the larger, more complicated
challenges presented to you every day.

## Warning: Work in Progress

This library is still in its infancy. So far we've collected the reps we're
doing ourselves and tried to organize them in a useful way. We're continuing to
add more Reps regularly as we build new reps for our own practice. As such, the
organization of the material in this repo is rather in flux at the moment.  We
appreciate your patience as the library grows, and would love your feedback on
how it could made more useful to you! Don't hesitate to create a Github Issue
for any questions or recommendations you might have.

## What is a Rep?

A "Rep" is a single tiny coding excerise that can be completed in a matter
of seconds to minutes. It is usually as simple as defining a data type or
implementing a single simple function.

In this library, Reps are grouped into Sets of Reps that are related
conceptually. Each Set has a comment at the top of the file to remind you what
the Reps are in that Set. You can copy that comment to get started. The rest
of the file shows a sample set of answers for the Reps. You can take a look at
these to make sure that your answers hit the important points of the Reps the
first couple of times that you do time.

## Library Organization

This library is organized into Levels of roughly ascending mastery of Haskell
concepts. Each level contains up to 10 Sets of reps, which are again ordered.
Each Set usually around 5 to 15 reps. We tried to keep these chunks small so
that you can always do at least 1 Set of reps per day, even if you only have
15 minutes. The first time you do a given Set, you may need to set aside more
time if you want to do it the first time without looking at the answers.

We recommend that you simply start at the beginning and proceed through the
Levels. Even if you're already comfortable with Haskell, there's always room
improve your muscle memory. If you find this too tedious to do reps at all, go
ahead and skip a few Sets foward until you find something slightly more
interesting. You'll always have the opporunity to go back and review old reps
in the future.

## How do a I do Reps?

The most important aspect of doing Reps is to make a habit of doing it every
single day. We recommend keeping a log of how many Reps you do each day to
help remind yourself and make it obvious when you miss a day. Keeping a Github
repo of the Reps you've done every day along with this log is a great way to
be able to look back at your progress. Here are a couple of real, down in the
dirt examples:

* https://github.com/qxjit/dailyReps
* https://github.com/jbrechtel/dailyReps
* https://github.com/gardenof/dailyReps

The amount of time you spend and the number of Reps you get done will depend
on your schedule and your current level of development. The more you do, the
faster your muscle memory will grow!

### Go do it!

To actually do some Reps, find Set1 in Level1 and copy the header comment into
your own blank file and start your compiler running so you can get feedback.
Then go through the items in the header one by one and implement them. If you
get stuck, you can peek back at the answers in the libary for help. Do this
every day until you can implement all the Reps in that Set without peeking
back. Then keep doing it until you can do them all without going back to the
comment at the top to figure out what's next each time.

If you make a mistake, don't just fix it and move on. That will train you brain
to make the same mistake next time and fix it afterwards again. Instead go back
to some logical point ahead of the mistake and redo that part of the Rep from
there, this time without making the mistake. If you really want to make sure
the correct way is imprinted on your neurons more deeply than the mistake, keep
redoing the section until you can do it 5 times perfectly in a row. Note: you
can't _un_learn a mistake, you just have to practice the _un_mistaken way until
it is the way your brain chooses by default. Of course, the easiest way to do
that is not to learn the mistake in the first place!

Once all the Reps in that Set are under your fingers, add in Set2 from Level1.
If you have the time, it's a good idea to keep doing previous Sets. At some
point you'll reach a limit of how many Sets you can do in a day and have to
retire some old Sets for the time being. That's perfectly ok, even if your
limit ends up being just 1 Set at a time.

It may you as little as a week to imprint a given Set on your neurons. It might
take longer if it's covering an area of Haskell that you're less comfortable
with. However long it takes you is ok. As long as you do it every day, you'll
make steady progress.

### Don't underestimate the value of old review

It's surprisingly useful to go back to subject matter you already have a handle
on and do Reps for it. Promoting an old subject from simply something you
understand to something that is stored in your muscles is a great way to
improve your productivity.

This can even apply to subject matter you've already done the Reps for in the
past. When you change up which Sets your doing, considering resurrecting some
retired Sets and re-doing them for a week or two to keep your muscles memory
fresh.

If you reach the end of the reps, go back to the beginning! Who knows, you may
even encounter some new Sets on your next pass through.

## Make your own Reps

You might not find Reps in this library for the subjects you want to cover
(yet!). Make your own Reps and do them. Open a pull request and contribute them
back to the library for others to do as well!
