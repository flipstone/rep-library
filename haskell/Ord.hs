  Data.Ord / Sorting lists

  - define an enum for player rank and build a manual Ord instance for it
  - sort a list of ranks into ascending order
  - sort a list of ranks into descinding ordering using Ord.Down
  - define a Player record with name and rank
      - Sort a list of players alphabetically using sortBy / comparing
      - Sort a list of players by rank using sortOn
  - Build a compare function for players that compares by name and then rank
      - Hint: use Ord.comparing to compare the fields
      - build one that is fully explicit
      - Then build one that uses the Ordering Semigroup
      - Then build one that uses the Ordering Semigroup and the (->) Semigroup
