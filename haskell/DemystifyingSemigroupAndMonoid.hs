Semigroup
  | Semigroups are types that "combine". They have an binary operation that
  | takes to items of the type and produces a result of the same type. That
  | operation must be associative. We often talk about Semigroups as
  | appending because that is a very common use case, but the operation is
  | not actually required to represent an append.

- Write out the Semigroup law

The following reps will help you remember what `<>` does for List, Ordering,
Maybe, a Function.

- Implement combineList1: actually implement appending for lists yourself
- Implement combineList2: Use a function from Data.List this time.
- Implement combineOrdering
- Implement combineMaybe (Using Semigroup of underlying type)
- Implement combineFunction (Using Semigroup of underlying type)

- Create a newtype around Int and implement Semigroup using addition
- Create a newtype around Int and implement Semigroup using multiplication

Monoid
  | Monoid are Semigroups for which there is a value that turns the Semigroup's
  | combining operation into the identify function. This value is called the
  | "identity" of the Semigroup operation, and is written as `mempty` in
  | Haskell. The Monoid laws express the notion of `mempty` being the
  | identity of the Semigroup.

- Write out the Monoid laws for mempty

These reps will help you remember what the Semigroup identity is for List,
Ordering, Maybe and Function.

- Implement memptyList
- Implement memptyOrdering
- Implement memptyMaybe
- Implement memptyFunction

- implement Monoid for your addition newtype from above
- implement Monoid for your multiplication newtype from above
